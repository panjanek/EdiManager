# EdiManager
Command line utility for controlling Edimax plugs and cameras remotely through Edimax cloud service.

# How it works
Sends commands and receives data from Edimax WiFi plugs and IP cameras using Edimax cloud service. Using EdiManager does not require being at the same network as the device nor to configure router port forwarding. Edimax plugs and cameras maintain connection to the cloud servers using undocummented protocol. EdiManager uses this protocol to control Edimax devices. Device id identified by Device ID (MAC address on a sticker). Access authenticated with password.
